# CUE Language Support

**CUE Language** support for the IntelliJ platform.

## Development
### IDE
Development is best in IntelliJ IDEA.

The following plugins are required for development:

- [GrammarKit 2020.3.1](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6606-grammar-kit)
- Gradle
- Kotlin, for Gradle build file support

### Lexer
The lexer is generated by JFlex. The definition is at `src/grammar/cue.flex`.

The following command regenerates the lexer:
```bash
./gradlew generateLexer
```
### Parser
The parser is generated with JetBrains' GrammarKit. GrammarKit is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.
The definition is at `src/grammar/cue.bnf`.

To update the parser and all related classes, open the `cue.bnf` file in your IDE and choose `Generate Parser` in the context menu of the editor.
